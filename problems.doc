Problem 1: Analysis: Gemini 1.5M Context vs RAG Approach
Direct Approach (Gemini 1.5M Context)
Pros:

Simplicity

No additional infrastructure needed
Direct implementation
Less maintenance overhead

Full Context Availability

Model sees the whole document at one time
Better understanding of document-wide context
Good for tasks requiring global understanding

Consistency

Responses consider the whole context
Less chance of missing important information
Better for document-wide analysis

Cons:

Resource-intensive

Higher token usage
More expensive for large documents
Longer processing time

Limitations

Even 1M context has limitations
May not be sufficient for very large documents
Potential performance degradation with large contexts



RAG Approach
Advantages:

Scalability

Can handle documents of any size
More efficient resource usage
Better for multiple document handling


Cost Efficiency

Only uses relevant chunks
Lower token usage
More economical for large-scale use


Performance

Faster response times
More focused answers
Better for specific queries



Disadvantages:

Complexity

Requires vector database
More complex implementation
Additional infrastructure needed


Context Fragmentation

Might miss broader context
Requires careful chunk sizing
Could miss cross-references



Recommendation
The choice between Gemini 1.5M context and RAG depends on several factors:

Document Size

Small documents (<100KB) → Gemini Direct
Large documents (>100KB) → RAG

Query Type

Broad understanding → Gemini Direct
Specific questions → RAG

Scale Considerations

Single document → Gemini Direct
Multiple documents → RAG

Budget Constraints

Cost-sensitive → RAG
Development time priority → Gemini Direct



For our PDF Chat API, considering typical PDF sizes and usage patterns, the Gemini 1.5M context is enough for most use cases because:

Most PDFs are under the context limit
Implementation is simpler and faster
Maintenance overhead is lower
Full context provides better coherence

However, if the application were to scale for:

Large number of large PDFs
High volume of queries
Cost optimization needs

Then, RAG implementation would be desirable for future improvement.

Problem 2: Handling Token Limit
Now let's look into how to handle queries whose output is larger than the 8196 token limit.
Here's my solution to this problem:
Current Issue
The problem arises when trying to get responses longer than 8196 tokens, as that is the maximum limit with the Gemini API. Thus, we might not get the whole information we seek.
Possible Solutions
1. Split and Combine Method
We can:

Split our question into fragments
Get the answers of each fragment
Join these fragments together

For example in python:CopyOriginal question: "Give me a complete summary of this document"

Split into:
1. "Summarize the first part of the document"
2. "Summarize the middle part"
3. "Summarize the final part"
2. Summarization Technique
Another way is to:
First - get short summary
Then ask specific questions about interesting parts
Put all information together
Like this:
textCopyStep 1: "Give me a brief overview"
Step 2: "Tell me more about [specific part from overview]"
Step 3: "Explain [another interesting part]"
3. Progressive Detail Method
We can start broad and get more specific:
Get main points first
Request elaboration for each key point
 Merge it all in order

My Suggestion
The most efficient approach, in my opinion, would be to try putting all of the above together: get a summary of understanding for key points, break the request into sub-requests according to that summary, and merge everything together in logical order.

How it will work: an example
textCopyUser: "Tell me all about project management that is contained in this document"

Our approach:
1. Get main topics: "List the main project management topics in this document"
2. For each topic: "Explain about "
3. Join all explanations with good transitions
Why This Works Better

We don't miss important information
Responses stay under the token limit
Information is organized and makes sense
It's like how we naturally learn: start with basics, then get details

Problems We Still Need to Watch For

Making sure parts connect well
Keeping track of what we've covered
Not repeating information
Making sense as a whole

Problem 3: LLM Performance Evaluation
How would you test the Large Language Model? Here goes my thinking on how to test the performance of LLMs: How to Test LLM Performance 1. Base Metrics Response time Success rate Error rate Token use 2. Quality Checks We can test whether answers are: Correct Makes sense Matches PDF content  Stay on topic 3. Types of Tests Make various kinds of testing: textCopySimple questions
What is the title?
When was this written?

Medium questions:
What are the main points?
Explain the first section

Hard questions:
Compare different parts
Find problems in the text
4. User Feedback System
Add a method for users to indicate if or not answers were good:

JST Simple thumbs up / down
Star rating between 1 - 5
 "Was this helpful?" button

5. Compare to Known Answers

Create test PDFs with questions and answers
See if LLM gives similar answers
Count how many times it is correct

My Suggestion for Testing

Create a Test Dataset:

python
test_cases = [
    {
        "pdf": "test1.pdf",
        "question": "What is this about?",
        "expected_answer": "Project requirements",
        "difficulty": "easy"
    },
    {    "pdf": "test2.pdf",
        "question": "Compare section A and B",
                "expected_answer": "Main differences.",
                "difficulty": "hard"
    }]

Check Different Things:

How fast it answers
If answers are right
If it understands the PDF
If it gives helpful answers



Keep Track of Results:



Create reports on the effectiveness of it
See what types of questions are challenging
Find what needs to be fixed

Real User Testing:

Let real people try
Get feedback
Fix problems they find

Things to Watch Out For

LLM might change answers each time
Some questions are harder to check
Need many test cases
Takes time to test everything
